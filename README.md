# Fractal-Cross
Using recursion, I built a fractal out of crosses. I am especially proud of this project because of how beautiful it looks and frankly because of how challenging it was to come up with the design that I would recursively recreate in the hopes of ending up with a beautiful image. After long hours of testing and debugging, the feeling I got when this fractal emerged was indescribable. However, after creating it, I found out that the design I used to build it was already a famous fractal. Since the code is 100% mine, this is just my take on the famous fractal.
