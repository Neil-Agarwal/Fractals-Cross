# Fractal-Cross
Using recursion, I built a fractal out of crosses. After creating it, I found out that the design I used to build it was already a famous fractal. However since the code is 100% mine, this is just my take on the famous fractal. i am especially proud of this project because of how beautiful it looks and frankly because of how challenging it was to build. After long hours of testing and debugging, the feeling I got when the fractal worked is undescribable.
